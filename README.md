<p align="center"> <b>  Astro-U-net:  Learning to Enhance Astronomical Images </b> </p>
<p align="center"><img src="img.png" height="210px"></p>

<p style="text-align:justify"> Astronomical images are essential for exploring and understanding the universe. Images often contains additive noise, which makes denoising mandatory step in post-processing data before further data analysis.  In order to maximise the efficiency and information gain in the post-processing of astronomical imaging, we decided to turn on machine learning. We propose Astro U-net, a fully-convolution neural network for image denoising and enhancement. We made many experiments and picked two of them -- Network 1 and Network 2. More details will be provided in in the upcoming paper. Stay tuned! </p>
