For star detection we are using <a href='https://www.astromatic.net/software/sextractor'>Sextractor</a>, tool for building a catalogue of objects from an astronomical image. For catalogue cross-match <a href='http://www.star.bris.ac.uk/~mbt/stilts/'>STILTS</a> and <a href='http://www.star.bris.ac.uk/~mbt/topcat/'>TOPCAT</a> are used. Files contains parameters used for stars detection. Image (generated by Network 1) shows flux errors (circles with full line) of stars cross-matched with original image. Cyan dashed circles represent objects detected just on image generated by network.
